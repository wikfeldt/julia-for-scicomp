20 minutes to Julia
===================

.. questions::

   - What does the basic syntax of Julia look like?

.. objectives::

   - Get familiar with the basics of Julia in 30 minutes.

Julia is a scientific programming language that is free and open
source - see https://julialang.org/ for downloads, documentation,
learning resources etc.. 

- Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance.
  Although Julia is dynamically typed and feels like a scripting language,
  Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms
  via [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).


     
Types
-----

   - booleans, numbers (int, float), strings and chars
   - vectors, matrices
   - tuples, named tuples
   - dictionaries
   - composite types - structs
   - abstract types - e.g. supertype(Float64)
     
     
Loops and conditionals
----------------------

   - for, if-else, while,
   - iterators


Functions
---------

   - named and anonymous functions
   - optional arguments
   - keyword arguments
   - multiple dispatch
   - splatting



Packages
--------


REPL and IDEs
-------------

A REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) reads input, evaluates
the expression, prints any output and then loops back.
Julia's REPL is highly versatile:

.. code-block:: julia

   > ?sum
   

- Pluto.jl
- Weave.jl
- Jupyter
