Types and multiple dispatch
===========================

.. questions::

   - How can Julia code run at or near the speed of C?
   - What is multiple dispatch and how does it work?

.. objectives::

   - Understand the concepts of JIT, type inference and code specialization
   - Understand how multiple dispatch is used in Julia


Sections
--------

- Explain types in more detail than in 20-min quickstart
- Good practices, e.g. when to declare types
- Explain how multiple dispatch works
- Using macros, show differences in low-level code depending on how types are used
     
Macros
------

- @code_lowered
- @code_typed & @code_warntype
- @code_llvm
- @code_native
