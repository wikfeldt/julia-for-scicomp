.. _learner-personas:

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This lesson material is targeted towards students, researchers and developers
who:
 - are already familiar with one or more programming languages (Python, R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, ...)
 - want to add a new exciting high-level yet performant language to their reportoar
 - might be mixing a high-level and a low-level language for performance reasons but want to make their life easier
 - need to analyze big data or perform computationally demanding modeling, analysis or simulations
 - want to develop code HPC systems and/or graphical processing units (GPUs) but prefer to stay within a
   productive high-level language.


About the course
----------------

This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center
Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in ENCCS workshops. It is aimed
at researchers and developers who want to learn a modern, high-level, high-performace 
programming language suitable for scientific computing, data science, machine learning
and high-performance computing on CPUs or GPUs.
Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes
multiple exercises along with solutions, and is therefore also useful for
self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.
Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for
practical advice.
