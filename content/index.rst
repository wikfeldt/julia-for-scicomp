.. _learner-personas:

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This lesson material is targeted towards students, researchers and developers
who:
 - are already familiar with one or more programming languages (Python, R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, ...)
 - want to add a new exciting high-level yet performant language to their reportoar
 - might be mixing a high-level and a low-level language for performance reasons but want to make their life easier
 - need to analyze big data or perform computationally demanding modeling, analysis or simulations
 - want to develop code HPC systems and/or graphical processing units (GPUs) but prefer to stay within a
   productive high-level language.
