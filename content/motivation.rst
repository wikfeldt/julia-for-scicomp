Motivation
==========

.. questions::

   - Why use Julia?
   - How good is the performance?

.. objectives::

   - Get inspired to try Julia

Julia is a scientific programming language that is free and open
source - see https://julialang.org/ for downloads, documentation,
learning resources etc. 

Some advantages of Julia:

- Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance.
  Although Julia is dynamically typed and feels like a scripting language,
  Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms
  via [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).
