Instructor's guide
==================

20 minutes to Julia
-------------------

This episode should be recommended to learners
as preparation material that should be studied
before a workshop.
It should however also be covered at the start
of a workshop to ensure everyone is on the same page,
but it can be covered quickly.  
The instructor should use the REPL, as it's important
that everyone gets familiar with it and most other
episodes are done in Jupyter notebooks.
