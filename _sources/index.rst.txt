Julia for high-performance scientific computing
===============================================

Julia is a scientific programming language that is free and open
source - see https://julialang.org/ for downloads, documentation,
learning resources etc. Bridging high-level interpreted and low-level
compiled languages, it offers high performance (comparable to C and
Fortran) without sacrificing simplicity and programming productivity
(like in Python or R).

Julia has a rich ecosystem of libraries aimed
towards scientific computing and a powerful in-built package manager
to install and manage their dependencies. Julia is also gaining ground
in HPC as it supports both threading and distributed-memory
parallelization as well as GPU computing.

This lesson starts with the basics of Julia, its syntax,
multiple-dispatch paradigm, package development and best practices. It
then moves on to topics relevant to high-performance scientific
computing, including an overview of powerful libraries for modeling
and machine learning, visualization, parallelization and GPU
computing.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This lesson material is targeted towards students, researchers and developers
who:

 - are already familiar with one or more programming languages (Python, R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, ...)
 - want to add a new exciting high-level yet performant language to their reportoar
 - might be mixing a high-level and a low-level language for performance reasons but want to make their life easier
 - need to analyze big data or perform computationally demanding modeling, analysis or simulations
 - want to develop code HPC systems and/or graphical processing units (GPUs) but prefer to stay within a
   productive high-level language.


About the course
----------------

This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center
Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in ENCCS workshops. It is aimed
at researchers and developers who want to learn a modern, high-level, high-performace 
programming language suitable for scientific computing, data science, machine learning
and high-performance computing on CPUs or GPUs.
Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes
multiple exercises along with solutions, and is therefore also useful for
self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.
Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for
practical advice.

Graphical and text conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Different graphical elements are used to organize the material.

Type-along sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type-along sections are intended for live coding where all participants 
type-along and appear in a separate text box, marked with a keyboard emoji:

.. type-along:: Defining a variables

  This is how you set a variable in Julia:

  .. code-block:: julia

    x = 1

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~

All lesson episodes (sections) end with one or more exercises for participants 
to practice what they've learned, marked with a hand-writing emoji. Sometimes 
there's also a solution:

.. exercise:: Printing to screen

  Which of these commands prints the value of the variable ``x``?

  1. ``print(x)``
  2. ``println(x)``
  3. ``write(x)``

  .. solution::

    Correct answer is both 1 and 2! ``println()`` uses ``print()`` and adds a new line.

Important information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes important information is displayed inside boxes with an exclamation mark emoji:

.. callout:: Important info

  Please don't hesitate to ask questions during the workshop!
